**Covid-19 Impact**

COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) is a respiratory illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It emerged in late 2019 in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread worldwide, leading to a global pandemic declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020.
It wreaked havoc causing millions of deaths worldwide, overwhelming healthcare systems and disrupting daily life. In response, vaccines were developed at an unprecedented speed, providing protection against severe illness and reducing the virus's spread.

As a **Data Analyst**, I reviewed the data to gain insights on the impact of covid-19 on the world and predict future trends.
My analysis was focused on answering key questions such as:

1. How did the death rate vary each day for each country? 
2. How much of the U.S. population was getting infected by covid everyday?
3. Countries infected the most
4. Countries with highest death counts
5. The number of vaccinated people

**About the Dataset**

The datasets were sourced from 'Our world in data'. One dataset had attributes corresponding to the covid related deaths such as deaths, cases, country, continent, population etc.. 
While the other dataset had attributes entailing information on the vaccinations. The datasets span 2 years (2019-2021) of information. 

**Exploring the data and answering key questions:**

To answer the key questions described above, it was necessary to focus on the attributes that pertained to the problem. Hence I began by selecting the columns needed.

The snapshot of the required attributes can be seen below:

**1. How did the death rate vary each day for each country?**

The query results were sorted by location and date. This was helpful in guaging how many deaths were occuring each day with respect to the total cases for each country. An increasing death percentage can be seen for Afghanistan.

**2. How much of the U.S. population was getting infected by covid everyday?**

This was useful in providing insight into the increasing infection rate in the United States population as the year progressed. A change from 8% to 9% infection rate can be seen in December itself.
