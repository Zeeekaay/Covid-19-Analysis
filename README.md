**Covid-19 Impact**

COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) is a respiratory illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It emerged in late 2019 in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread worldwide, leading to a global pandemic declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020.
It wreaked havoc causing millions of deaths worldwide, overwhelming healthcare systems and disrupting daily life. In response, vaccines were developed at an unprecedented speed, providing protection against severe illness and reducing the virus's spread.

As a **Data Analyst**, I reviewed the data to gain insights on the impact of covid-19 on the world and predict future trends.
My analysis was focused on answering key questions such as:

1. Total cases to death ratio in the world
2. Percentage of world population effected
3. Countries infected the most
4. Countries with highest death counts
5. The number of vaccinated people

**About the Dataset**

The datasets were sourced from 'Our world in data'. One dataset had attributes corresponding to the covid related deaths such as deaths, cases, country, continent, population etc.. 
While the other dataset had attributes entailing information on the vaccinations. The datasets span 2 years (2019-2021) of information. 

**Exploring the data and answering key questions:**

To answer the key questions described above, it is necessary to focus on the attributes that pertained to the problem. Hence I began by selecting the columns needed.
